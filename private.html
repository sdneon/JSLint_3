<p><a href="http://www.crockford.com/javascript">JavaScript</a> is <a href="http://www.crockford.com/javascript/javascript.html">the
world's most misunderstood programming language</a>. Some believe
that it lacks the property of <i>information hiding</i> because
objects cannot have private instance variables and methods. But this
is a misunderstanding. JavaScript objects can have private members.
Here's how.</p>

<h2>Objects</h2>

<p>JavaScript is fundamentally about <i>objects</i>. Arrays are
objects. Functions are objects. Objects are objects. So what are
objects? Objects are collections of name-value pairs. The names are
strings, and the values are strings, numbers, booleans, and objects
(including arrays and functions). Objects are usually implemented as
hashtables so values can be retrieved quickly.</p>

<p>If a value is a function, we can consider it a <i>method</i>. When
a method of an object is invoked, the <tt>this</tt> variable is set
to the object. The method can then access the instance variables
through the <tt>this</tt> variable.</p>

<p>Objects can be produced by <i>constructors</i>, which are
functions which initialize objects. Constructors provide the features
that classes provide in other languages, including static variables
and methods.</p>

<h2>Public</h2>

<p>The members of an object are all <i>public</i> members. Any
function can access, modify, or delete those members, or add new
members. There are two main ways of putting members in a new
object:</p>

<h3>In the constructor</h3>

<p>This technique is usually used to initialize public instance
variables. The constructor's <tt>this</tt> variable is used to add
members to the object.</p>

<blockquote><pre>function Container(param) {
    this.member = param;
}</pre></blockquote>

<p>So, if we construct a new object</p>

<blockquote><pre>var myContainer = new Container('abc');</pre></blockquote>

<p>then <tt>myContainer.member</tt> contains <tt>'abc'</tt>.</p>

<h3>In the prototype</h3>

<p>This technique is usually used to add public methods. When a
member is sought and it isn't found in the object itself, then it is
taken from the object's constructor's <tt>prototype</tt> member. The
prototype mechanism is used for inheritance. It also conserves
memory. To add a method to all objects made by a constructor, add a
function to the constructor's <tt>prototype</tt>:</p>

<blockquote><pre>Container.prototype.stamp = function (string) {
    return this.member + string;
}</pre></blockquote>

<p>So, we can invoke the method</p>

<blockquote><pre>myContainer.stamp('def')</pre></blockquote>

<p>which produces <tt>'abcdef'</tt>.</p>

<h2>Private</h2>

<p><i>Private</i> members are made by the constructor. Ordinary
<tt>var</tt>s and parameters of the constructor becomes the private
members.</p>

<blockquote><pre>function Container(param) {
    this.member = param;
    var secret = 3;
    var that = this;
}</pre></blockquote>

<p>This constructor makes three private instance variables:
<tt>param</tt>, <tt>secret</tt>, and <tt>that</tt>. They are attached
to the object, but they are not accessible to the outside, nor are
they accessible to the object's own public methods. They are
accessible to private methods. Private methods are inner functions of
the constructor.</p>

<blockquote>
  <pre>function Container(param) {

    function dec() {
        if (secret &gt; 0) {
            secret -= 1;
            return true;
        } else {
            return false;
        }
    }

    this.member = param;
    var secret = 3;
    var that = this;
}</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>The private method <tt>dec</tt> examines the <tt>secret</tt>
instance variable. If it is greater than zero, it decrements
<tt>secret</tt> and returns <tt>true</tt>. Otherwise it returns
<tt>false</tt>. It can be used to make this object limited to three
uses.</p>

<p>By convention, we make a private <tt>that</tt> variable. This is
used to make the object available to the private methods. This is a
workaround for an error in the ECMAScript Language Specification
which causes <tt>this</tt> to be set incorrectly for inner
functions.</p>

<p>Private methods cannot be called by public methods. To make
private methods useful, we need to introduce a privileged method.</p>

<h2>Privileged</h2>

<p>A <i>privileged</i> method is able to access the private variables
and methods, and is itself accessible to the public methods and the
outside. It is possible to delete or replace a privileged method, but
it is not possible to alter it, or to force it to give up its
secrets.</p>

<p>Privileged methods are assigned with <tt>this</tt> within the
constructor.</p>

<blockquote>
  <pre>function Container(param) {

    function dec() {
        if (secret &gt; 0) {
            secret -= 1;
            return true;
        } else {
            return false;
        }
    }

    this.member = param;
    var secret = 3;
    var that = this;

    this.service = function () {
        return dec() ? that.member : null;
    };
}</pre>
</blockquote>

<p><tt>service</tt> is a privileged method. Calling
<tt>myContainer.service()</tt> will return <tt>'abc'</tt> the first
three times it is called. After that, it will return <tt>null</tt>.
<tt>service</tt> calls the private <tt>dec</tt> method which accesses
the private <tt>secret</tt> variable. <tt>service</tt> is available
to other objects and methods, but it does not allow direct access to
the private members.</p>

<h2>Closures</h2>

<p>This pattern of public, private, and privileged members is
possible because JavaScript has <i>closures</i>. What this means is
that an inner function always has access to the vars and parameters
of its outer function, even after the outer function has returned.
This is an extremely powerful property of the language. There is no
book currently available on JavaScript programming that shows how to
exploit it. Most don't even mention it.</p>

<p>Private and privileged members can only be made when an object is
constructed. Public members can be added at any time.</p>

<h2>Patterns</h2>

<h3>Public</h3>

<blockquote><tt>function </tt><i>Constructor</i><tt>(</tt>...<tt>)
   {</tt>

   <blockquote><tt>this.</tt><i>membername</i><tt> =
      </tt><i>value</i><tt>;</tt></blockquote>

   <p>}<br>
   <i>Constructor</i><tt>.prototype.</tt><i>membername</i><tt> =
   </tt><i>value</i><tt>;</tt></p></blockquote>

<h3>Private</h3>

<blockquote><tt>function </tt><i>Constructor</i><tt>(</tt>...<tt>)
   {</tt>


  <blockquote><tt>var that = this;<br>
      var </tt><i>membername</i><tt> = </tt><i>value</i><tt>;</tt>


    <p><tt>function </tt><i>membername</i><tt>(</tt>...<tt>) {</tt>...<tt>}</tt></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><tt>}</tt></p>
  <p>Note: The function statement</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><tt>function
      </tt><i>membername</i><tt>(</tt>...<tt>) {</tt>...<tt>}</tt></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>is shorthand for</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><tt>var </tt><i>membername</i><tt> = function </tt><i>membername</i><tt>(</tt>...<tt>)
    {</tt>...<tt>};</tt></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<h3>Privileged</h3>

<blockquote><tt>function</tt> <i>Constructor</i><tt>(</tt>...<tt>)
   {</tt>


  <blockquote><tt>this.</tt><i>membername</i><tt> = function (</tt>...<tt>) {</tt>...<tt>};</tt></blockquote>

   <p><tt>}</tt></p></blockquote>
