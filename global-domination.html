				<small>June 1, 2006 at 11:27 am by Douglas Crockford | In <a href="http://www.yuiblog.com/blog/category/development/" title="View all posts in Development" rel="category tag">Development</a> | <a href="#comments" title="Comment on Global Domination">29 Comments</a></small>

			<p>JavaScript, as realized in browsers, is a load-and-go programming
language. Programs are delivered to the execution site as text. This is a
 good fit for the web, which is at its root a text delivery system. The
program text is  <code>eval</code>‘d, which compiles it into an
executable form and then immediately executes it. That execution can
leave artifacts in the window’s global object.</p>
<p>The global object is the global namespace that holds the top level
functions and global variables. Variables which are not explicitly
defined are implied global variables, and their names are also kept in
the global object. This was a convenience for the little scripts that
Navigator 2 was expected to support. In the decade since NS2, those
little scripts have grown into Ajax applications, and the true nature of
 the global object is revealed:</p>
<p><strong>Global variables are evil.</strong></p>
<p>Global variables are a source of unreliability and insecurity.
Fortunately, JavaScript includes tools for allowing us to drastically
minimize our use of globals, which makes our programs more robust. This
becomes increasingly important as our programs get bigger, and as we mix
 in and mash up program components from multiple authors. Reducing our
dependency on globals increases the likelihood that collisions are
avoided and that the program components work harmoniously.</p>
<p>An objective measure of the quality of a JavaScript program is <em>How many global variables and global functions does it have?</em>
 A large number is bad because the chance of bad interactions with other
 programs goes up. Ideally, an application, library, component, or
widget defines only a single global variable. That variable should be an
 object which contains and is the root namespace for all of your stuff.</p>
<p>Yahoo’s single global is <code>YAHOO</code>. It is spelled in all
caps to identify it as something special, since all lower case is
ordinary and initial caps indicates a constructor. Being in all caps, it
 is unlikely that someone would use it accidentally, which further
reduces the likelihood of collision.</p>
<p>Yahoo is the world’s biggest website. Eventually, all of Yahoo’s JavaScript and browser webstate will be accessible through the <code>YAHOO</code> object.</p>
<p>But this technique also works well with the smallest library or
widget. It is a clean, efficient way of organizing your program’s
resources. The performance hit in having to access through a single
global is negligible. JavaScript is very good at resolving such
expressions. It is more than offset by the self-documentation and
reliability benefits.</p>
<p>Generally a shallow tree is better than a deep tree. One could imagine that <code>YAHOO.util.Dom.get</code> could have been factored more compactly perhaps as  <code>YAHOO.get</code>. And perhaps someday it will, but for now <code>YAHOO.util.Dom.get</code>
 is not measurably slower, and it is helping Yahoo to manage its
evolving codebase. (And if you don’t like the length, you only have to
type it once. See <a href="with-statement-considered-harmful.html"><code>with</code> Statement Considered Harmful</a>.)</p>

	<p>I can’t agree less than 100%. Lots of global variables hanging
around is one thing, and good quality JS code is another. And these two
things rarely meet one another.</p>
<p>I would like to read more about global namespace pollution via
prototype extension of native JS objects (String, Array, etc). Isn’t it
equally bad? And what should be said for some very popular JS libraries
that are doing just that?</p>

	<p>Theodor Zoulias: Good point on the prototype extension of native
objects. It’s conceivable that extending a string and/or some other
object could potentially collide with another author’s extension of the
same object.</p>
<p>However, I also agree with the Douglas that through namespacing you can avoid similar situations as pertaining to your own code.</p>

<p>What does that mean? Does that mean “you do agree more than 100%”? You disagree with less than whole?</p>
<p>&gt; Lots of global variables hanging around is one thing, and good quality JS code is another</p>
<p>I’m not sure I fully understand that either. Indeed, lots of global
variables is one thing, and quality code is another. When there is lots
of global variables, then the quality of the code becomes bad (or is
considered to not have as good of quality).</p>
<p>Typically when working with YUI utils I like to set up the following shortcuts in my own private scope of my applications:</p>
<p><code>MyApp.example = function() {<br>
  var $E = YAHOO.util.Event;<br>
  var $D = YAHOO.util.Dom;<br>
  var $M = YAHOO.util.Motion;<br>
  var $ = $D.get;<br>
  return {<br>
    init : function() {<br>
      $E.on(['a','b','c'], 'click', this.fly, $('bar'), true);<br>
    },<br>
    fly : function() {<br>
      var attributes = {<br>
        width : { by : 50 },<br>
        height : { by : 50 },<br>
        points : { to : [100,200] }<br>
      };<br>
      var anim = new $A(this, attributes);<br>
      anim.animate();<br>
    }<br>
  };<br>
}();</code></p>
<p>The greatest part of it is that it allows me to have my own amount of verbosity. The lookups come at a very, very small price.</p>

Ok, I needlessly made overly complex a simple phrase. I just wanted to
express my total agreement with Mr Crockford’s arguments. :-)</p>
<p>Your code snippet seems very elegant to me. But as far as I can
understand your shortcut-using method makes your code faster, not
slower. In other words the lookups come at a negative price I think.</p>

	<p>Indeed Theodor, they actually do come at a very small negative
price. I actually don’t mind the extra time – they are literally
unnoticeable, even in larger files. You can profile the extra weight
over a thousand lookups and see for yourself that it’s very small.</p>

<p>Agreed, but how does it define the global variable?</p>
<p>1: var YAHOO = {};<br>
2: YAHOO = {};<br>
3: window.YAHOO = {};<br>
4: self.YAHOO = {};</p>

“Comments are always wrong.” My translation of that is that code can be
